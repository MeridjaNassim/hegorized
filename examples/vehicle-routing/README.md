# Vehicle Routing Problem

The Vehicle Routing Problem is related to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Given the position of cities, the position of a depot and a number of vehicles, find the best tour for each vehicle so that every city is visited and the total length is minimal.

This example uses the example VRP from [Google's OR-Tool examples](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/vrp#python).

Solution approaches are quite naive and don't produce state of the art results.
