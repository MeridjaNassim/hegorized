# Traveling Salesman Problem

In the traveling salesperson problem, a salesperson, who lives in one of the cities, is expected to make a round trip visiting all the other cities and returning home. (It doesn't actually matter which city is the starting point.) The requirement is that the total distance traveled be as small as possible.

This example directory covers a TSP problem called [att48](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/tsp/tsp.html) with a minimal tour length of 33523.
